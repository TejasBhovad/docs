# Introduction

The following repository contains all the c program files given to solve in lectures.
Currently the repository contains :

- Old programs
- [Loop Patterns](c/patterns/programs)
- [Arrays Programs](c/arrays/programs)
- [Journal Programs](https://github.com/TejasBhovad/journal-1)
- [Pointers Programs](c/pointers)
- [Recursion Programs](c/recursion)
- [String Programs](c/string/)
- [Practicals Programs](https://github.com/TejasBhovad/practicals)

To download all files, click on download zip and then unzip the file from your downloads folder.

Note: The program files are compiled using VS Code with code-runner extension and not using turboC so to compile code in TurboC you might need to add `<conio.h>` `clrscr()` `getch()`

## Linux commands

`cd Desktop/` - change working directory

`touch hello.c` - create a file named 'hello.c' on desktop

`gcc hello.c -o out` - compile the 'hello.c' file in out

`./out` - run c file
