## CRUD Operations in MongoDB

### 1. Create Operations

Create operations are used to insert new documents into a collection. If the specified collection does not exist, MongoDB will create it automatically.

#### Methods:

- **`insertOne()`**: Inserts a single document into a collection.
- **`insertMany()`**: Inserts multiple documents into a collection.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Insert a single document
db.students.insertOne({
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 21,
  major: "Computer Science",
});

// Insert multiple documents
db.students.insertMany([
  { name: "Jane Smith", age: 22, major: "Mathematics" },
  { name: "Sam Brown", age: 20, major: "Physics" },
]);
```

### 2. Read Operations

Read operations are used to retrieve documents from a collection. You can specify query filters to narrow down the results.

#### Methods:

- **`find()`**: Retrieves documents from a collection. You can use filters to specify which documents to return.
- **`findOne()`**: Retrieves a single document that matches the specified criteria.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Retrieve all documents
db.students.find().pretty();

// Retrieve documents with a specific condition
db.students.find({ major: "Computer Science" }).pretty();

// Retrieve a single document
db.students.findOne({ name: "Jane Smith" });

// Retrieve students who are majoring in Computer Science and are older than 20
db.students
  .find({ $and: [{ major: "Computer Science" }, { age: { $gt: 20 } }] })
  .pretty();

// Retrieve students who are majoring in Mathematics and have an age of 22
db.students.find({ major: "Mathematics", age: 22 }).pretty();
```

### 3. Update Operations

Update operations modify existing documents in a collection. You can update one or multiple documents based on specified criteria.

#### Methods:

- **`updateOne()`**: Updates a single document that matches the specified criteria.
- **`updateMany()`**: Updates multiple documents that match the specified criteria.
- **`replaceOne()`**: Replaces a single document with a new document.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Update a single document
db.students.updateOne({ name: "John Doe" }, { $set: { age: 22 } });

// Update multiple documents
db.students.updateMany(
  { major: "Mathematics" },
  { $set: { major: "Applied Mathematics" } }
);

// Replace a document
db.students.replaceOne(
  { name: "Sam Brown" },
  { name: "Samuel Brown", age: 21, major: "Physics" }
);
```

### 4. Delete Operations

Delete operations are used to remove documents from a collection. You can delete one or multiple documents based on specified criteria.

#### Methods:

- **`deleteOne()`**: Deletes a single document that matches the specified criteria.
- **`deleteMany()`**: Deletes multiple documents that match the specified criteria.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Delete a single document
db.students.deleteOne({ name: "John Doe" });

// Delete multiple documents
db.students.deleteMany({ major: "Physics" });
```

## Aggregation in MongoDB

Aggregation in MongoDB is a powerful feature that allows users to process and analyze data from multiple documents in a collection. It enables complex data transformations and computations, making it essential for generating reports, analyzing trends, and summarizing data.

### What is Aggregation?

Aggregation operations in MongoDB group values from multiple documents together and perform various computations on the grouped data to return a single result. This is similar to SQL's `GROUP BY` clause, where data is grouped and aggregated.

### Key Features of Aggregation:

- **Data Transformation**: Aggregation allows for the transformation of data as it passes through different stages.
- **Multiple Stages**: Aggregation pipelines can consist of multiple stages, each performing a specific operation on the data.
- **Flexibility**: Aggregation can handle complex queries and calculations, providing flexibility in data analysis.

### Aggregation Methods

MongoDB provides two primary methods for performing aggregation:

#### 1. Aggregation Pipeline

The aggregation pipeline is the preferred method for performing aggregations in MongoDB. It consists of a sequence of stages that process documents and transform the data.

##### Basic Structure:

```javascript
db.collection.aggregate([
    { $stage1: { /* stage1 operations */ } },
    { $stage2: { /* stage2 operations */ } },
    ...
])
```

##### Example:

To calculate the total number of tutorials written by each user in a collection:

```javascript
db.tutorials.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$by_user", num_tutorial: { $sum: 1 } } },
]);
```

This query will output a result similar to the following table:

| \_id    | num_tutorial |
| ------- | ------------ |
| "user1" | 5            |
| "user2" | 3            |
| "user3" | 7            |

The `$group` stage groups the documents by the `by_user` field and counts the number of documents for each user using the `$sum` operator with a constant value of `1`.

#### 2. Single-Purpose Aggregation Methods

These methods provide simple access to common aggregation operations without the complexity of an aggregation pipeline. Examples include `count()`, `distinct()`, and `estimatedDocumentCount()`.

##### Example:

To count the total number of documents in a collection:

```javascript
db.collection.countDocuments();
```

This query will return the total number of documents in the specified collection.

### Common Aggregation Operators

MongoDB supports various operators that can be used within aggregation stages:

- **`$sum`**: Calculates the total sum of a specified field.
- **`$avg`**: Computes the average value of a specified field.
- **`$min`**: Finds the minimum value of a specified field.
- **`$max`**: Finds the maximum value of a specified field.
- **`$count`**: Counts the number of documents in a group.
- **`$push`**: Adds values to an array in the resulting document.

##### Example of Using Multiple Operators:

To calculate the average likes per user and total likes:

```javascript
db.tutorials.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$by_user",
      total_likes: { $sum: "$likes" },
      average_likes: { $avg: "$likes" },
    },
  },
]);
```

This query will output a result similar to the following table:

| \_id    | total_likes | average_likes |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| "user1" | 250         | 50.0          |
| "user2" | 150         | 50.0          |
| "user3" | 350         | 50.0          |

The `$group` stage groups the documents by the `by_user` field, calculates the total likes using the `$sum` operator, and computes the average likes using the `$avg` operator.
