# Linear Queues

Elements in queues are added from one end and deleted from other.<br/><br/>
The end from which elements are added is called **rear end**, and the end from where elements are deleted is called **front end**.
Therefore Queues are **First in First Out**

### Operations

1. **Enqueue**: Adding elements to the queue
2. **Dequeue**: Removing elements from the queue

### Errors

1. **Overflow**: When the queue is full but user tries to enqueue an element.

```c
// condition:
rear == N - 1
```

2. **Underflow**: When the queue is empty but user tried to denqueue an element.

### Disadvantages

When elements are popped the size of queue decreases.

```c
// condition:
(front > rear) OR (front == -1 && rear == -1)
```
