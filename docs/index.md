# C Programs

This documentation will contain all the Data Structures programs organized category-wise

Th programs were created in vscode so they should run fine on online compilers but may need changes if ran on turbo c compiler.

## Compilation

### Linux

1. Open Terminal
2. `cd Desktop/` - change the current working directory to Desktop
3. `touch filename.c` - create a file named `filename.c` in current working directory
4. `gcc filename.c -o out` - compiling the `filename.c` file in binary file `out`
5. `./out` - to run the compiled program

:::note

- If your program uses Math functions use `gcc filename.c -o out -lm` instead

- You can create a new directory named `foldername` in linux using `mkdir foldername` command
