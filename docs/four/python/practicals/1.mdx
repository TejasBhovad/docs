> Write a program that takes a score as input and assigns a letter grade based on the following criteria:\
> Score >= 90: Grade 'A'\
> Score >= 80: Grade 'B'\
> Score >= 70: Grade 'C'\
> Score < 60: Grade 'F'

```python
marks = int(input("Enter your marks: "))

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif marks >= 80:
    print("Grade B")
elif marks >= 70:
    print("Grade C")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade D")
else:
    print("Grade F")

# Output:
# Enter your marks: 85
# Grade B
# Enter your marks: 75
# Grade C

```
