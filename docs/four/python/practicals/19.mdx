> Implement function overriding in Python, where a child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.

```python
class Parent:
    def method(self):
        print("Parent Method")

class Child(Parent):
    def method(self):
        print("Child Method")

child = Child()
child.method()

# Output:
    # Child Method
```

:::note

To compile and run the program, you can use the following commands:

```bash
python3 foo.py
```

:::note

Yes it is same as the previous practical, but it is a good practice to repeat the same practicals to get a better understanding.
Also we coudnt find any other practicals to add here.
