> Implement a try-except block in Python that handles a specific exception, such as a ZeroDivisionError.

```python
try:
    a = 10
    b = 0
    c = a/b
    print(c)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Divide by zero error")
except:
    print("Some error")
finally:
    print("Finally block")

# Output:
# Divide by zero error
# Finally block

```

:::note

To compile and run the program, you can use the following commands:

```bash
python3 foo.py
```
