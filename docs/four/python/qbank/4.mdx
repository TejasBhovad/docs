> Write a program that demonstrates file operations in Python.

```python
import os

def append_to_file(filename, content):
    with open(filename, "a") as file:
        file.write(content + "\n")

def delete_file(filename):
    os.remove(filename)
    print('File deleted successfully!')

filename = "test.txt"

append_to_file(filename, "This is some appended text.")

delete_file(filename)
```

:::note

To compile and run the program, you can use the following commands:

```bash
python3 foo.py
```

:::note

You require a file named `test.txt` in the same directory as the program to run the program.
