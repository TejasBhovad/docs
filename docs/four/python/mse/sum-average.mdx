```python
# WAP to calculate sum and average of strings

list = []

n = int(input("Enter the number of elements in the list: "))

for i in range(0, n):
    element = int(input("Enter element: "))
    list.append(element)

print("The list is: ", list)

sum = 0
for i in list:
    sum = sum + i
print("The sum of the elements in the list is: ", sum)

avg = sum / n
print("The average of the elements in the list is: ", avg)

# Output:
# Enter the number of elements in the list: 3
# Enter element: 10
# Enter element: 20
# Enter element: 30
# The list is:  [10, 20, 30]
# The sum of the elements in the list is:  60
# The average of the elements in the list is:  20.0
