## Shell script

- Shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix/Linux shell which could be one of the following:

  - The Bourne Shell
  - The C Shell
  - The Korn Shell
  - The GNU Bourne-Again Shell

- A shell is a command-line interpreter and typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

- Shell scripts are also employed extensively in the default installations of Unix-like operating systems.

- Shell scripts are executed by a shell process.

- Shell scripts often serve as convenient wrappers around UNIX commands.

- They automate sequences of UNIX commands that would otherwise be time-consuming to type into the keyboard.

- A shell script is a text file containing shell commands.

## Shell Script Example

```sh
# This is a comment!
echo Hello World        # This is a comment, too!
```

- The first line tells Unix that the file is to be executed by /bin/bash.

- This is a comment. The second line is also a comment.

- The third line actually does something. It asks that the words Hello World be printed.

- The #! characters are magic to Unix. They are the characters that tell Unix that what follows is the name of the program (or programs in the case of a pipeline).

- The # character begins a comment, and Unix ignores the rest of the line.

- The echo command prints its arguments, in this case, the words "Hello World".

- The echo command is one of the most basic and frequently used commands in Linux.

## Executing Shell Scripts

- To execute the script from the current directory, you can run:

```sh
$ ./hello.sh
```

- this wont run unless you give it permission to run

```sh
$ chmod +x hello.sh
```

## Shell Variables

- A shell variable is a special variable that is set by the shell and is required by the shell in order to function correctly.

- Some of these variables are environment variables whereas others are local variables.

- A local variable is a variable that is present within the current instance of the shell.

- It is not available to programs that are started by the shell.

- They are set at the command prompt.

- To set a local variable, use the following syntax −

```sh
variable_name=variable_value
```

- To access a local variable, use the following syntax −

```sh
$variable_name
```

- Example

```sh
NAME="Zara Ali"
echo $NAME
```
