## Fork

`fork` - create a new process

```bash
fork
```

We use C program to create a new process. The program is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
  fork();
  printf("Hello world!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

To compile and run the program, use the following commands(dont copy the `$` sign, it represents the terminal prompt):

```bash
$ gcc fork.c -o fork
$ ./fork
```

> This will create a new process and print "Hello world!" twice. The `fork` system call is used to create a new process.
