## Banker's Algorithm

The Banker's algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm that is used to prevent deadlock in a system. The Banker's algorithm is used to allocate resources to processes in a way that prevents deadlock. The Banker's algorithm is based on the concept of a safe state. A safe state is a state in which the system can allocate resources to processes in such a way that no process will be left waiting indefinitely for resources.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int need[2][3] = {{3, 2, 2}, {2, 1, 1}};
    int max[2][3] = {{7, 5, 3}, {4, 3, 2}};
    int avail[3] = {3, 2, 2};

    int safe = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        int can_finish = 1;
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            if (need[i][j] > avail[j]) {
                can_finish = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (can_finish) {
            printf("Process %d can finish safely.\n", i + 1);
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                avail[j] += max[i][j];
            }
        } else {
            safe = 0;
        }
    }

    if (safe) {
        printf("The system is in a safe state.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The system is in an unsafe state (deadlock possible).\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

```

## Compiling and Running the Banker's Algorithm

To compile and run the Banker's algorithm, you can use the following commands:

```bash
gcc -o banker banker.c
./banker
```

### Output

```bash
Process 1 can finish safely.
Process 2 can finish safely.
The system is in a safe state.
```

The output of the program shows that the system is in a safe state and that both processes can finish safely. This means that the system can allocate resources to the processes in such a way that no process will be left waiting indefinitely for resources.
