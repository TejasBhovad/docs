## Partitioning Algorithms

Partitioning algorithms are used to divide the memory into partitions to allocate memory to processes. There are two types of partitioning algorithms:

1. First Fit
2. Best Fit
3. Worst Fit

### First Fit

In the first fit algorithm, the memory is divided into partitions and the first partition that is large enough to fit the process is allocated to the process. The process is allocated to the first partition that is large enough to fit the process.

### Best Fit

In the best fit algorithm, the memory is divided into partitions and the partition that is closest in size to the process is allocated to the process. The process is allocated to the partition that is closest in size to the process.

### Worst Fit

In the worst fit algorithm, the memory is divided into partitions and the largest partition that is large enough to fit the process is allocated to the process. The process is allocated to the largest partition that is large enough to fit the process.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define MAX_PROCESSES 10
#define MAX_MEMORY 100

struct Process {
    int pid;
    int size;
};

void firstFit(struct Process processes[], int n, int memory[], int m) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int found = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (memory[j] >= processes[i].size) {
                memory[j] -= processes[i].size;
                printf("Process %d allocated to memory block %d\n", processes[i].pid, j);
                found = 1;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!found) {
            printf("Process %d not allocated (no fit)\n", processes[i].pid);
        }
    }
}

void bestFit(struct Process processes[], int n, int memory[], int m) {
    int best_idx = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        best_idx = -1;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (memory[j] >= processes[i].size) {
                if (best_idx == -1 || memory[j] < memory[best_idx]) {
                    best_idx = j;
                }
            }
        }
        if (best_idx != -1) {
            memory[best_idx] -= processes[i].size;
            printf("Process %d allocated to memory block %d\n", processes[i].pid, best_idx);
        } else {
            printf("Process %d not allocated (no fit)\n", processes[i].pid);
        }
    }
}

void worstFit(struct Process processes[], int n, int memory[], int m) {
    int worst_idx = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        worst_idx = -1;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (memory[j] >= processes[i].size) {
                if (worst_idx == -1 || memory[j] > memory[worst_idx]) {
                    worst_idx = j;
                }
            }
        }
        if (worst_idx != -1) {
            memory[worst_idx] -= processes[i].size;
            printf("Process %d allocated to memory block %d\n", processes[i].pid, worst_idx);
        } else {
            printf("Process %d not allocated (no fit)\n", processes[i].pid);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    struct Process processes[] = {{1, 20}, {2, 15}, {3, 10}, {4, 30}};
    int n = sizeof(processes) / sizeof(processes[0]);

    int memory[MAX_MEMORY];
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_MEMORY; i++) {
        memory[i] = 10; // Simulate memory blocks of size 10
    }
    int m = sizeof(memory) / sizeof(memory[0]);

    printf("** First Fit Allocation **\n");
    firstFit(processes, n, memory, m);

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        memory[i] = 10; // Reset memory for next algorithm
    }

    printf("\n** Best Fit Allocation **\n");
    bestFit(processes, n, memory, m);

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        memory[i] = 10; // Reset memory for next algorithm
    }

    printf("\n** Worst Fit Allocation **\n");
    worstFit(processes, n, memory, m);

    return 0;
}

```

To compile and run the program, use the following commands(dont copy the `$` sign, it represents the terminal prompt):

```bash
$ gcc partition.c -o partition
$ ./partition
```

> This program demonstrates the first fit, best fit, and worst fit partitioning algorithms to allocate memory to processes.
