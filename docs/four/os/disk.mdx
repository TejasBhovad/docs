## Disk Partition

Disk partitioning is the process of dividing the disk into multiple logical storage units called partitions. Each partition can be used to store data and files. Disk partitioning is done to organize the data and improve the performance of the disk.

### Types of Disk Partitioning

- FCFS
- SSTF
- SCAN
- C-SCAN
- LOOK
- C-LOOK

### FCFS (First Come First Serve)

In the FCFS disk scheduling algorithm, the disk head moves from one end of the disk to the other end, serving the requests in the order they arrive. The disk head moves in the direction of the request and serves the requests in the order they arrive.

### SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)

In the SSTF disk scheduling algorithm, the disk head moves to the request that is closest to the current position of the disk head. The disk head moves to the request that is closest to the current position of the disk head.

### SCAN

In the SCAN disk scheduling algorithm, the disk head moves from one end of the disk to the other end, serving the requests in the order they arrive. When the disk head reaches the end of the disk, it reverses direction and moves to the other end of the disk.

### C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)

In the C-SCAN disk scheduling algorithm, the disk head moves from one end of the disk to the other end, serving the requests in the order they arrive. When the disk head reaches the end of the disk, it moves to the other end of the disk without serving any requests.

### LOOK

In the LOOK disk scheduling algorithm, the disk head moves to the request that is closest to the current position of the disk head. The disk head moves to the request that is closest to the current position of the disk head.

### C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)

In the C-LOOK disk scheduling algorithm, the disk head moves to the request that is closest to the current position of the disk head. The disk head moves to the request that is closest to the current position of the disk head.
