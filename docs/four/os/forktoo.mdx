## Fork

`fork` - create a new process

```bash
fork
```

We use C program to create a new process. The program is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
  pid_t pid, mypid, myppid;
  pid = getpid();
  printf("Before fork: Process id is %d\n", pid);
  pid = fork();

  if (pid < 0) {
    perror("fork() failure\n");
    return 1;
  }

  // Child process
  if (pid == 0) {
    printf("This is child process\n");
    mypid = getpid();
    myppid = getppid();
    printf("Process id is %d and PPID is %d\n", mypid, myppid);
  } else { // Parent process
    sleep(2);
    printf("This is parent process\n");
    mypid = getpid();
    myppid = getppid();
    printf("Process id is %d and PPID is %d\n", mypid, myppid);
    printf("Newly created process id or child pid is %d\n", pid);
  }

  return 0;
}

```

To compile and run the program, use the following commands(dont copy the `$` sign, it represents the terminal prompt):

```bash
$ gcc fork.c -o fork
$ ./fork
```

> This will create a new process and print the process id of the parent and child process. The `fork` system call is used to create a new process.
