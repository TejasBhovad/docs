## CP command

The `cp` command in Linux is used to copy files and directories. The `cp` command is part of the GNU coreutils package and is available on most Linux distributions.

The `cp` command syntax is as follows:

```bash
cp [OPTION]... SOURCE DEST
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 4096

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int src = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
    int dst = open(argv[2], O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644);

    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    ssize_t nread;

    while ((nread = read(src, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE)) > 0) {
        write(dst, buffer, nread);
    }

    close(src);
    close(dst);

    return 0;
}

```

To compile and run the program, use the following commands(dont copy the `$` sign, it represents the terminal prompt):

```bash
$ gcc cp.c -o cp
$ ./cp source.txt destination.txt
```

> There should be a file named `source.txt` and `destination.txt` in the same directory as the program.

<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between the cp command and the mv command?</summary>
  <div>
    The `cp` command is used to copy files and directories, while the `mv` command is used to move files and directories. When you copy a file, the original file remains intact, while moving a file removes it from its original location.

<details>
  <summary>What is the use of the `open` system call in the program?</summary>
  <div>
    The `open` system call is used to open a file for reading or writing. In the program, we use the `open` system call to open the source and destination files.

<details>
  <summary>What is the use of the `read` and `write` system calls in the program?</summary>
  <div>
    The `read` system call is used to read data from a file descriptor, and the `write` system call is used to write data to a file descriptor. In the program, we use the `read` and `write` system calls to copy data from the source file to the destination file.
