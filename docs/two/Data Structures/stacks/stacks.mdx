# Stack

A stack has only one entry/exit point.

LIFO: Last in First Out. It implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first.

Stack is used for managing order of processes

## Operations

**Push**: add an element to the stack <br/>
**Pop**: remove an element from the stack<br/>
**Peek**: display the topmost element of the stack

## Errors

1. **Stack overflow**: When user tries to add an element to a already full stack.
2. **Stack underflow**: When user tries to remove an element from an empty stack.

## Code

<CodeBlock language="c">{file_1}</CodeBlock>
