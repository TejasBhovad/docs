# Singly Linked List

## CASES IN INSERTION

1. At Start of linkedlist
2. At End of linkedlist
3. After a defined(key) element
4. Before a defined(key) element

## CASES IN DELETION

1. Delete Elements from Start
2. Delete Elements from End
3. Delete Inputted Elements

## THEORY

### Display

- use a temporary variable[*current] to store value of head in it
- print the value of data of temporary variable [current->data]
- set temporary variable to next address of temporary variable

### Create Node

- a new node is created and required memory is allocated
- set the next address of this created element to null
- IF (HEAD==0) <br/>
  -> set head to new node<br/>
  -> set temp to new node<br/>
- INPUT value of data of new node
- RETURN new node

### Add Node at Start

- IF (HEAD==0)<br/>
  -> throw error that linked list is not defined
- ELSE<br/>
  -> set new node to function call to create function<br/>
  -> set next address of new node to head<br/>
  -> set head to new node<br/>
- RETURN head

### Add Node at End

- IF (HEAD==0)<br/>
  -> throw error that linked list is not defined
- ELSE<br/>
  -> set new node to function call to create function<br/>
  -> use a temporary variable and store value of head in it<br/>
  -> iterate through the list till you find the last element<br/>
  -> set next address of current variable to new node<br/>
  -> set temp to new node<br/>
- RETURN head
