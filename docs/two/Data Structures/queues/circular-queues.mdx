# Circular Queues

### Operations

1. **Enqueue**: Adding elements to the queue
2. **Dequeue**: Removing elements from the queue

### Errors

1. **Overflow**: When the queue is full but user tries to enqueue an element.

```c
// condition:
(front == 0 && rear == N - 1) || (rear == front - 1)
```

2. **Underflow**: When the queue is empty but user tried to denqueue an element.

```c
// condition:
(front == -1 && rear == -1)
```
